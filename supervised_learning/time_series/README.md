Time Series Forecasting is the process of predicting future values based on previously observed values. Itâ€™s widely used in finance, weather prediction, and stock/cryptocurrency trading.

In this project, I used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to forecast the closing price of Bitcoin (BTC). The idea is to train a model that looks at the past 24 hours of BTC prices and predicts the next hour's price.
