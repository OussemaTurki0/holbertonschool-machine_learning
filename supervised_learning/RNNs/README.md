Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 

This project implements various recurrent neural network architectures in pure Python using NumPy. It is designed to help you understand and experiment with the internals of RNNs without relying on external ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Architectures Implemented
RNNCell: Basic Recurrent Neural Network cell

GRUCell: Gated Recurrent Unit cell with update/reset gates

LSTMCell: Long Short-Term Memory cell with forget/input/output gates

Deep RNN: Multi-layer RNN using stacked RNNCells

Bidirectional RNN: Combines forward and backward passes for better context understanding
