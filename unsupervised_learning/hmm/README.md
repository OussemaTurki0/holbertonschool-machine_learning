This project explores Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a powerful statistical tool used in many areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, and bioinformatics.

The project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School and focuses on understanding the behavior of Markov Chains and implementing key algorithms used in HMMs.
