# Data Augmentation

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of **data augmentation** techniques in TensorFlow to artificially expand image datasets. Data augmentation is useful for improving the performance of deep learning models when the amount of available training data is limited.

The project covers the following image transformations:

- Horizontal flip
- Random crop
- 90-degree rotation
- Random contrast adjustment
- Random brightness adjustment
- Hue adjustment

Additionally, it includes guidance on **automating data augmentation** using machine learning.
